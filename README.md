🛒 Blinkit Grocery Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

As part of my learning in data analytics and visualization, I created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze Blinkit’s grocery sales data. The goal was to gain insights into product performance, outlet types, and customer preferences using a structured dataset.

 The dashboard allows stakeholders to filter and explore sales trends, product performance, and outlet insights in a dynamic way.
